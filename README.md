spiral
======

Animated procedural ascii-art spiral written in spiral-obfuscated C.

How to run
----------

Just need C compilation:

```
gcc spiral.c -o spiral -lm
./spiral
```

Otherwise, I provided a readable python version:

```
python spiral.py
```

It should be run in a terminal that can handle ANSI/VT100 control escape sequence.
